While I was learning [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org), I created a [presentation](/presentation.html) in RevealJS to help my team learn about it. 

The presentation shows how I used the same content files to generate:
- A RevealJS [presentation](/presentation.html)
- A [PowerPoint presentation](/presentation.pptx) using my team's template
- This website (starting after the header below)
- A scholarly-looking [article](/article.pdf) in PDF using LaTeX
- A scholarly-looking [document](/article.doc) using Microsoft Word
