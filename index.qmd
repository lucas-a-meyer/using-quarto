```{python}

Folowing the spirit of ["learning out loud"](https://www.meyerperin.com/2019-02-13-why-you-should-blog-if-you-are-a-data-scientist.html), I created several artifacts while I was learning about [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org). 

I created one main content file [(source)](https://github.com/lucas-a-meyer/using-quarto/blob/main/_presentation-content.qmd) that I used to create:

- A RevealJS [presentation](/presentation.html)
- A [PowerPoint presentation](/presentation.pptx) using my team's template
- This website, starting after the "Why Quarto" header below [(source)](https://github.com/lucas-a-meyer/using-quarto/blob/main/index.qmd)

The RevealJS presentation is embedded below:
<div>

```{=html}
<iframe class="slide-deck" src="presentation.html"></iframe>
```

</div>

I also reused some of the content above in another Quarto file [(source)](https://github.com/lucas-a-meyer/using-quarto/blob/main/article.qmd) to create:

- A scholarly-looking [article](/article.pdf) in PDF using LaTeX
- A scholarly-looking [document](/article.docx) using Microsoft Word
