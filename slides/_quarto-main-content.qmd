### Writing the main content

Most writing in Quarto is done in [Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

Quarto's Markdown supports everything I'm
used to: figures, tables, bibliography, etc.

It also supports lots of extra features, like
diagrams with `mermaid` and `GraphViz` and
even LaTeX equations: 

$$
E = mc^2
$$
