## Where I think Quarto is good (July 2022)

### Articles: maybe yes

I think Quarto is more helpful for a team that already uses Git **with** Python notebooks or LaTeX to write articles. Microsoft Word collaboration through SharePoint and Teams is easier than Git and Quarto... but it's not reproducible.

### Python notebook: excellent

Quarto adds to Python notebooks without detracting anything. All you need are a few YAML lines.

### Blog: excellent

Quarto allows me to have a scriptable, Python-based blog. I can automate my blog to tweet and post to LinkedIn when I write new articles.

### Presentations: maybe not

Only if you have

- *a lot* of dynamic content
- Reproducibility needs
- Collaborators used to Git/Beamer
