## Where I think Quarto is good (July 2022)

### Articles: maybe

I think Quarto is more helpful for a team that already uses Git **with** Python notebooks or LaTeX to write articles. 

Microsoft Word collaboration through SharePoint and Teams is easier than Git and Quarto... but it's not reproducible.

### Python notebook: excellent

Quarto adds features to Python notebooks without detracting anything. You just need a few YAML lines.

### Blog: excellent

Quarto allowed me to have a scriptable, Python-based [blog](https://www.meyerperin.com). I can automate my blog to tweet and post to LinkedIn when I write new articles.

### Presentations: special cases

For PowerPoint, render process => long edit cycle. Still useful for:

- *a lot* of dynamic content
- Reproducibility needs
- Collaborators used to Git/Beamer 

Quarto works great for RevealJS.
