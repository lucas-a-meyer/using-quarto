## Where Quarto excels (July 2022)

### Articles: maybe

I think QuartoÂ® is more helpful for a team that already uses Git **with** Python notebooks or LaTeX to write articles. 

Microsoft Word collaboration through SharePoint and Teams is easier than Git and Quarto... but it's not reproducible.

### Python notebook: excellent

Quarto adds features to Python notebooks without detracting anything. You just need a few YAML lines.

### Blog: excellent

Quarto allowed me to have a scriptable, Python-based [blog](https://www.meyerperin.com). I wrote code to post new articles to Twitter and LinkedIn.

### Presentations: maybe

Great for RevealJS. For PPT, render process -> long edit cycle. Useful for:

- *a lot* of dynamic content
- Reproducibility needs
- Collaborators used to Git/Beamer
