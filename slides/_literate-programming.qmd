Donald E. Knuth proposed literate programming in a 1984 [article](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf).

One of my proudest tech moments was to make `CWeave` and `CWeb` (and LaTeX) run in a Windows computer circa 1998.

Jupyter notebooks implement that paradigm, as does Quarto. This makes it easier to publish content.
