Donald E. Knuth proposed literate programming in a 1984 [article](http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf).

One of my proudest tech moments was to make `CWeave` and `CWeb` (and `LaTeX`) run in a Windows computer circa 1998.

Jupyter implements the literate programming paradigm, but generating high-quality output requires additional tools.
