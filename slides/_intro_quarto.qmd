[QuartoÂ®](https://www.quarto.org) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

The name comes from the format of a book or pamphlet printed with eight pages of text, four to a side, then folded twice to produce four leaves.

The earliest known European printed book, the Sibyllenbuch (Gutemberg, c.1452), was done in the quarto format, as were many of Shakespeare's plays.
