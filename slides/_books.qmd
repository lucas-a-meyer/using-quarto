## Books in Quarto

You can also write books with quarto. From the same collection of `.qmd` files, Quarto can generate:

- ePub
- PDF
- Online book

Two recent examples are:

- [Hands-on Programming in R](https://jjallaire.github.io/hopr/), by Garrett Grolemund [(source)](https://github.com/jjallaire/hopr/)
- [Python for Data Analysis, 3E](https://wesmckinney.com/book/), by Wes McKinney [(source)](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book/tree/3rd-edition)

## Hands-on Programming in R

This is a free [book](https://jjallaire.github.io/hopr/), and you can see the Quarto [(source)](https://github.com/jjallaire/hopr/) that generated it.
