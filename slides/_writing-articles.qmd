## Writing scholarly articles

I reused some of the content of this presentation to create two scholarly-looking articles. The purpose of the articles is just to show how easy it is to generate them with Quarto, they don't contain original research. Quarto add cross-reference, citations and bibliography support to Markdown.

The relevant files are:
