## Writing scholarly articles

I reused some of the content of this presentation to create two scholarly-looking articles. 

The purpose of the articles is just to show how easy it is to generate them with Quarto, they don't contain original research. 

Quarto adds cross-reference, citations and bibliography support to Markdown.
