## The content value chain

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

The value of content stuck in my computer is near zero. Putting content out in the world increases its value substantially.

### Goal

- Move good content out of my computer **as fast as possible**
- Reproducible
- Git-based collaboration
- Write once, generate:
  - Code
  - Paper
  - PowerPoint
  - Site/documentation
