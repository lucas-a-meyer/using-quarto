## Hacks

Quarto is under active development, and quickly reaching v1.0. While creating this content, I had to do some workarounds.

1. I created a [script](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/1232) to quickly install the latest version
2. Mermaid diagrams blank in PPTX. [Bug](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/1159) quickly fixed.
3. Mermaid diagrams blank in RevealJS. Workaround: refresh.
4. HTML website and RevealJS from same source: images disappear
    - Workaround: add `self-contained: true` to YAML front-matter
5. Pandoc large monospaced font size in PowerPoint. Workaround: [script](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/1272).
6. The decorations on this slide only appear on RevealJS, by design.
7. Slide with article screenshots renders weird in HTML, no workaround.
