## PowerPoint templates

By adding a `reference-doc` entry to your YAML, you can tell
Quarto (and pandoc) to use a file as a template for the format
of your presentation. 

The "Slide Master" needs to contain layouts named as per the previous slide (e.g. "Comparison").

This allows you a lot of flexibility in the design of your
slide deck, even if it is for just the small number of layouts
that were listed in the previous slide.

You can control fonts, add background images, page numbering, etc.
