## Next Steps

- The Quarto website has great tutorials:
    - [Jupyter](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/jupyter.html)
    - [VSCode](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/vscode.html)

- If you have multiple input files (e.g., [blog](https://www.meyerperin.com) or book), you can create a [project](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html). This allows rendering multiple files that link to each other.

- Projects can have pre- and post-render steps in Python, R, Lua and shell script
