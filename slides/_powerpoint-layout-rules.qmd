## PowerPoint layout rules

The rules are available at: <br />
<https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#powerpoint-layout-choice>

- **Title Slide:** created from metadata fields like `title` and `author`
- **Section Header:** created from the top-level headings (`#`)
- **Two Content:** used when `.qmd` source contains `:::: {.columns}` and only **text** content. [Previous slide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucas-a-meyer/using-quarto/main/slides/_powerpoint-slides.qmd) is an example.
- **Comparison:** same as "Two Content", but content of columns is not text
- **Content with Caption:** used when slide has non-text content, but no columns
- **Title and Content:** whatever doesn't fit the rules above.
