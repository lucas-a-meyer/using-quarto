## PowerPoint layout rules

The rules are available at: <br />
<https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#powerpoint-layout-choice>

- **Title Slide:** created from metadata fields like `title` and `author`
- **Section Header:** created from the top-level markdown headings (for example, `#`)
- **Two Content:** used when `.md` source contains `.columns` div (`:::: {.columns}`) and text content
- **Comparison:** same as "Two Content", but content of divs is not text
- **Blank:** used for slides that have no displayable content (e.g. notes)
- **Content with Caption:** used when content doesn't have a `columns` div but has text **and** non-text content
- **Title and Content:** whatever doesn't fit the rules above.
