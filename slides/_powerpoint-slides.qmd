## Creating PowerPoint slides

:::: {.columns}

To generate a presentation from a `.qmd` file, add `format: pptx` to the YAML front-matter.

The part I liked the _least_ is that Quarto will use the 
[pandoc PowerPoint rules](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#powerpoint-layout-choice) 
to render the content from the `.qmd` into the `.pptx`.

The "pandoc rules" substantially limit the flexibility you would have in PowerPoint presentations. 
Quarto has better presentation support for `revealjs` and `beamer`.

- Quarto can use a template with (**only**) these layouts:
    - Title Slide
    - Title and Content
    - Section Header
    - Two Content
    - Comparison
    - Content with Caption
    - Blank
