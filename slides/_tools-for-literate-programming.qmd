## I tried many tools for Literate Programming

### LaTeX

- Needs extra tools like CWeb
- Great for PDFs... Beamer for slides
- Not great for websites
- Dynamic content -> code in Latex
    - `\usepackage{ifthen}`
    - `@for`, `@while`

### Python notebooks

- Great, with Pandoc
- Config separated from files

::: {.column}

### Word/PPT

- Hard to collaborate before O365
- Hard to reproduce / auto-generate 
  - code and writing separate

### RMarkdown

- Great for everything
- Heavily dependent on R
- New features in Quarto
