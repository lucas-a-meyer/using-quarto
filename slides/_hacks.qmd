## Hacks {background-color="black" background-image="images/hacks.png" background-size="250px" background-position="top right"}

Quarto is under active development, and quickly reaching v1.0. While creating this content, I had to do some workarounds.

1. I create a script to quickly install the latest version
2. Mermaid diagrams blank in PPTX. Issue quickly fixed.
3. Mermaid diagrams blank in RevealJS. Workaround: refresh.
4. HTML website and RevealJS from same source: images disappear
    - Workaround: add `self-contained: true` to YAML front-matter
5. Pandoc large monospaced font size in PowerPoint. Workaround: script.
6. The decorations on this slide only appear on RevealJS, no workaround.
7. Slide with article screenshots renders weird in HTML, no workaround.
