## Hacks {background-color="black" background-image="images/hacks.png" background-size="150px" backgound-position="right"}

Quarto is under active development, and quickly reaching v1.0. While creating this content, I had to do some workarounds.

1. I create a script to quickly install the latest version
2. Mermaid diagrams were blank in PPTX. I opened an issue that was quickly fixed.
3. Mermaid diagrams need refresh in RevealJS. I didn't submit an issue yet.
4. Creating a HTML website & HTML RevealJS from the same source, images disappear
    - Workaround: add `self-contained: true` to the YAML front-matter of both
5. Pandoc can't change monospaced font size in PowerPoint. I wrote a script.
6. The decorations on this slide only appear on RevealJS, no workaround.
7. The slide with the article screenshots render weird in HTML. No workaround.
