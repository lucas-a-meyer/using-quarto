## Cross references

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

The [Quarto guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) has a great section on [cross-references](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html). I cover only the main points.

To create a cross-referenceable figure, section or equation, you need to tag it with its corresponding prefix, respectively "fig", "sec" and "eq".

To tag it, use the following syntax: `#prefix-name`.

::: {.column}

For example, when declaring a figure, you can use:

``` markdown
![Elephant](elephant.png){#fig-elephant}
```

Later, you can refer to it using:

``` markdown
See @fig-elephant for an illustration.
```
