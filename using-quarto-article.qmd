# Introduction

Here I write some very interesting thing

# Data

Here I describe the data I'm using

# Theory

Is dependency ratio correlated to GDP Growth? We examine this with a few data points.

# Code

```{python}
#| echo: true

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

# Conclusion

This is where things end
