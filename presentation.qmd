# Scholarly articles

## Generating a scholarly article

I reused some of the content of this presentation to create two scholarly-looking articles. The purpose of the articles is just to show how easy it is to generate them with Quarto, they don't contain original research.

The relevant files are:

- [Quarto source file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucas-a-meyer/using-quarto/main/article.qmd)
- [Microsoft Word output](https://www.meyerperin.com/using-quarto/article.docx)
- [LaTeX PDF output](https://www.meyerperin.com/using-quarto/article.pdf)

## Citations and Footnotes

Citations don't work on presentations, but are easy to add to documents. 

You need a BibTex file, e.g., `bibliography.bib`, and a reference to it `bibliography: references.bib` to the YAML front-matter. Quarto supports any [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/).

You can cite by using `[@citation-name]` in your text. Please check the [article .qmd source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucas-a-meyer/using-quarto/main/article.qmd)
and the [PDF](https://www.meyerperin.com/using-quarto/article.pdf) and [DOCX](https://www.meyerperin.com/using-quarto/article.docx) outputs.

Generating footnotes is also easy. Using `[^ref]` links to a footnote, and `[^ref: content of the footnote]` generates its content[^f1].

[^f1]: You can use footnotes in presentations and websites, too

# Should I use Quarto?

## Where I think Quarto is good (July 2022)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

### Articles: maybe yes

I think Quarto is more helpful for a team that already uses Git **with** Python notebooks or LaTeX to write articles. Microsoft Word collaboration through SharePoint and Teams is easier than Git and Quarto... but it's not reproducible.

### Python notebook: excellent

Quarto adds to Python notebooks without detracting anything. All you need are a few YAML lines.

### Blog: excellent

Quarto allows me to have a scriptable, Python-based blog. I can automate my blog to tweet and post to LinkedIn when I write new articles.

### Presentations: maybe not

Only if you have

- *a lot* of dynamic content
- Reproducibility needs
- Collaborators used to Git/Beamer
