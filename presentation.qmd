## Generating a scholarly article

I reused some of the content of this presentation to create two scholarly-looking articles. The purpose of the articles is just to show how easy it is to generate them with Quarto, they don't contain original research.

The relevant files are:

- [Quarto source file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucas-a-meyer/using-quarto/main/article.qmd)
- [Microsoft Word output](https://www.meyerperin.com/using-quarto/article.docx)
- [LaTeX PDF output](https://www.meyerperin.com/article.pdf)

## Citations and Footnotes

It's very easy to use citations in Quarto. All you need is a BibTex file with your citations, for example, `bibliography.bib`, and to add `bibliography: references.bib` to the YAML front-matter of your document. 
You can then refer to the bibliography by simply adding the appropriate `[@citation-name]` in your text.

Generating footnotes is also easy, using `[^ref]` links to a footnote, and `[^ref: content of the footnote]` generates its content[^f1].

[^f1]: You can use footnotes in presentations and websites, too

# When is Quarto worthwhile

## Using Quarto Everywhere?

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}

I have been using Quarto a lot lately. Here's my current (July 2022) take on when it's worthwile.

### Blog: excellent

I wanted to have a Python-based blog for a long time, and Quarto delivers it well. Now I can automate my blog to tweet and post to LinkedIn when I write new articles.

### Python notebook: excellent

If I would be doing something in a Python notebook, I don't lose anything by doing it on Quarto, and the extra work is very small.

### Writing articles: unsure

I think Quarto is more helpful for a team that uses Git **with** Python notebooks or LaTeX to write articles. Microsoft Word collaboration through SharePoint and Teams is easier than Git and Quarto... but it's not reproducible.

### Presentations: probably not

The best case for generating a presentation with Quarto are when you need to generate *a lot* of dynamic content. Other cases:

- Reproducibility
- Collaborators used to Git/Beamer
